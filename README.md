# Real Academic Citation Generator

## 🎯 Purpose
This tool takes **YOUR text** and adds **REAL academic citations** from actual published papers with verified DOI links. It does NOT generate fake citations - every reference comes from real academic databases.

## ✅ What This Tool Does

1. **You paste your text** (paragraphs, essays, research content)
2. **The tool analyzes each sentence** and searches real academic databases
3. **Real papers are found** and matched to your sentences
4. **Citations are added** with proper formatting and DOI links
5. **You get your text back** with real, verifiable academic references

## 🎛️ Optional API Keys

While all APIs work WITHOUT keys, you can optionally add them for benefits:

### Semantic Scholar API Key (Optional)
- **Get it**: https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api#api-key-form
- **Benefit**: Higher rate limits (5000 requests/5 min)
- **Add in**: "API Configuration" section

### CrossRef Email (Recommended)
- **What**: Just your email address
- **Benefit**: Access to "polite pool" with faster responses
- **Add in**: "API Configuration" section

## 📝 Example Workflow

**Input:**
```
Machine learning has revolutionized healthcare diagnostics. 
Deep learning algorithms can detect diseases from medical images. 
Natural language processing analyzes patient records efficiently.
```

**Output:**
```
Machine learning has revolutionized healthcare diagnostics [1][2]. 
Deep learning algorithms can detect diseases from medical images [3][4].

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### How It Works
1. **Text Parsing**: Splits input into individual sentences
2. **Keyword Extraction**: Identifies key terms from each sentence
3. **API Queries**: Searches each API with extracted keywords
4. **Result Filtering**: 
   - Removes duplicates
   - Filters by year range
   - Requires DOI (optional)
   - Sorts by citation count (optional)
5. **Citation Assignment**: Assigns papers to sentences
6. **Formatting**: Applies chosen citation style
7. **Display**: Shows text with citations and references

### API Request Examples

**Semantic Scholar:**
```javascript
GET https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=machine+learning&limit=5&fields=title,authors,year,venue,citationCount,externalIds,abstract
```

**CrossRef:**
```javascript
GET https://api.crossref.org/works?query=deep+learning&rows=5&filter=from-pub-date:2020&mailto=your@email.com
```

**arXiv:**
```javascript
GET https://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:neural+networks&start=0&max_results=5
```

## 🛡️ Rate Limiting & Best Practices

The tool includes:
- ✅ Automatic delays between requests (500ms)
- ✅ Progress tracking
- ✅ Error handling for API failures
- ✅ Fallback to other APIs if one fails
- ✅ De-duplication across APIs

## 📋 Current Limitations

1. **API Rate Limits**: 
   - Semantic Scholar: 100 req/5min (without key)
   - Free usage may be slower for large texts
   
2. **Search Accuracy**: 
   - Depends on keyword extraction from sentences
   - Shorter sentences may get less accurate matches
   
3. **Coverage**:
   - Not all sentences may find relevant papers
   - Highly specific topics may have fewer results

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add more APIs (PubMed, Google Scholar via SerpAPI, etc.)
- [ ] Implement caching to avoid re-searching
- [ ] Add manual citation selection
- [ ] Save/load citation databases
- [ ] BibTeX import/export
- [ ] API key encryption for security
